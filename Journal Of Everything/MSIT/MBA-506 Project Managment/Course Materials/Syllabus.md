#### Course Description and Prerequisites

This course is designed to introduce a systematic process for initiating, planning, executing, and controlling projects. Students will evaluate recognized methodologies for completing projects, more quickly, and with fewer problems. Students will establish an effective foundation in traditional project management methods, which consist of readings, research, class special-topic presentations, and participation in a real-world project as it unfolds. Students will also be encouraged to apply project-management techniques to solve existing real-world business problems.

Pre-requisites: None

#### Student-Centered Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to: 

- Gain a deeper level of knowledge related to the subject (e.g. factual knowledge, methods, principles, generalizations, theories) that includes the ability to explain the nature and character of projects, and the influences and forcing functions acting upon them from the environments in which they exist.
- Apply course material to a simulated project by developing the artifacts and applying processes to plan, implement and conclude a project, including managing schedule, budget, requirements and change.
- Find, evaluate, and use resources to explore a topic in depth through analysis, writing, diagrammatic form and collaboration.

2. Engage substantively throughout the discussion period by responding to others with questions or comments that demonstrate interest, build upon the ideas of others, and encourage elaboration.
3. Apply and integrate concepts from this course as well as from quality resources including journals, websites, readings from another class, relevant work or life experience, etc.
4. Demonstrate attention to style, structure, grammar, etiquette, and proper citation of references to maintain academic integrity.

Discussion grades are determined using the rubric below. The descriptions show what exemplary work looks like for each aspect of an overall discussion.

#### Assignments

There will be weekly assignments in the form of discussion forums, written assignments and personal learning journals. You are expected to read the subject matter located in the course thoroughly. There are often multiple sources assigned in order to give a well-rounded perspective on the week’s topic. You should complete all assigned readings. You are encouraged to perform additional scholarly research using the [Champlain Library](https://www.champlain.edu/academics/library/)

[Champlain Library](https://www.champlain.edu/academics/library/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/). If you find you are struggling to identify a citable real-world example to support your position, you are encouraged to look at the [Project Research Seeds](https://champlain.instructure.com/courses/2421404/pages/project-research-seeds "Project Research Seeds") resource for inspiration.

Assignments are described in Canvas and are subject to change. Emails and course announcements will be posted throughout the entire course so be certain to check in these areas often. You are expected to “check-in” and participate in discussion forums a minimum of 5 separate days per week.

The class will generally run a Sunday midnight through Sunday midnight cycle. That is, new course material will commence on Sunday at midnight and the associated assignments, discussions, case studies, exams and papers will be due no later than the following Sunday at midnight local time unless otherwise directed. These assignments may address case studies and/or will require research on your part. Online discussions, however, will occur throughout the week.
