# Week 5: Overview & Resources

## Scheduling

This week we will continue forward from the Work Breakdown Structure and Estimation techniques that we learned about last week and use them as inputs to develop the project schedule. From a detailed schedule, the project manager can extrapolate a detailed cost estimate and projection of the overall project duration. Further by identifying the critical path of the project, we can refine our risk register and determine where to best place contingency reserves in order to protect the project.

### Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Estimate activity duration and construct a project schedule
- Investigate and justify the critical path in a schedule
- Explore and reflect on key Project Managment terms and Knowledge

	    - *This chapter introduces the foundational elements of schedule development including task definition, estimating activity duration and task dependencies. It also introduces the concept of critical path and the technique to identify the critical path in a schedule.*

This article exposes you to common misconceptions of the work breakdown structure (WBS). It expands upon the decomposition activities needed to develop a quality WBS and provides examples based on scenarios that you may recognize from your own life. It opens the door to how the WBS informs the project schedule, which is the topic of next week’s lesson.*
