# Create Hiring Proposal for Limbo'd Hire

1. Wait until the ePAR is processed so you have an employee ID
2. Create a draft hiring proposal:
	1. Enter the Employee ID
	2. Enter the Start Date
	3. Attach the final signed letter
3. Send me or Ian a link to the draft hiring proposal
4. We will skip it to Offer Accepted so the posting gets filled.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!
