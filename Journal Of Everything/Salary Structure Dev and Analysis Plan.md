[[Salary Structure Dev Index]]
# **Understanding the Current State**
- What compensation data do we currently have for each job family, sub-family, career type, and level?
	-  Hourly Rate,
	- Annual Rate, 
	- FLSA Exemption Status, 
	- Term length (9, 10, 11, 12 months), 
	- temporary/permanent status,
	- CUPA Higher education benchmarks per job
	- Access to salary.com benchmarks, but not systematically mapped
	- SOC BLS Burlington, Vermont, US National Data
- How do our current salaries  compare to market rates for similar positions?
	- #TODO: Build a dynamic dashboard for compiling, visualizing, displaying aggregated and individualized  benchmarks.
- What internal pay equity issues exist today that we should address?
	- #TODO Run internal equity analyses for cpd attributes and departments (others?)
# **Market Positioning**
- What is our target market positioning (e.g., 50th percentile, 75th percentile)?
- Which industry benchmarks or salary surveys are most relevant for our higher education context?
	- CUPA
	- Salary.com
	- BLS SOC at MSA, State, National Levels
- Should different job families be positioned differently in the market?
	- If not job family, some other level of detail?
# **Structure Design**
- What should be the overlap between adjacent salary bands?
	- Low overlap: 15-25%, clearer delineation, but potentially greater increases for promotions/transfers
	- High overlap: 40-50%, less well defined levels but greater flexibility
- How wide should each band be (min to max range)?
	- Based on 10th, 50th, 90th % ranges for job benchmarks within band
	- Career progression pathways, timelines?
	- Narrow bands: 20-30% 
		- specialized, 
		- little room for growth, 
		- tightly capped max, 
		- promotes promotion as means for pay
	- Wider bands:  40-60%
		- wide range of skill level and growth ability
		- enables pay increases without promotion
- Should we use different band widths for different career types or levels?
- How many distinct salary bands do we need across our structure?

# **Implementation**
- What is our budget for implementing the new structure?
- Should we phase in the implementation or do it all at once?
- How will we handle employees whose current salaries fall below or above their new bands?
- What policies should govern movement through the bands (e.g., performance-based increases)?
# **Communication and Governance**
- How will we communicate the new structure to employees?
- What appeals process should we establish for position classifications?
- Who will have authority to approve exceptions to the salary bands?
- How frequently should we review and update the salary structure?
# **Long-term Sustainability**
- How will we handle inflation adjustments to the bands over time?
- What metrics should we track to evaluate the effectiveness of the new structure?
- How will we integrate this structure with our performance management processes?
