>I’d like to cover the following topics:
> - SU inclusion or exclusion from the band development and accompanying analyses
> - Internal equity and alignment across the newly defined CPD attributes
> - Comparable external market benchmarks (CUPA R1, R2, Salary.com, others?)
> - Status of the Salary.com implementation
