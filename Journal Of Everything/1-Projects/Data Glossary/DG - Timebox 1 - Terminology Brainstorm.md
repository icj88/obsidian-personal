# Questions for Larger Data Governance Group

## Foundational Governance Questions

### 1. Scope and Boundaries
- **Should this be an HR-specific glossary or institution-wide?**
    - Evidence: Terms like NetID and IPEDS are clearly cross-functional
    - Decision needed: Create separate institutional glossary or expand this one?
- **How do we handle terms that span multiple departments?**
    - Examples: VISA holder (HR and/or Student), Tuition Remission (HR or Student)
    - Options: Single ownership, shared ownership, or duplicate entries?
### 2. Glossary Type and Purpose
- **Is this a business glossary or a data glossary?**
    - Current mix includes: Business processes (Performance Management), System fields (Employee ID), Regulatory concepts (FMLA)
    - Decision needed: Separate into multiple glossaries or maintain unified approach?
- **What's the primary audience and use case?**
    - Data analysts building reports?
    - HR staff understanding processes?
    - Compliance and audit purposes?
### 3. Technical vs. Business Separation
- **Should system-specific terms be in the same glossary as business concepts?**
    - Examples: PeopleSoft HCM, ePAR, eAPF vs. Employee, Benefits, Performance Management
    - Consideration: System terms may become obsolete with technology changes
## Cross-Functional Terms Requiring Institution-Wide Decisions
### 4. Identity and Access Management
- **NetID**: Who owns the definition institution-wide?
- **Employee ID vs Student ID**: How do these relate across systems?
### 5. Reporting and Compliance Terms
- **IPEDS**: Should this be owned by Institutional Research rather than HR?
- **Compliance terms** (ADA, FMLA): Do these definitions need Legal review?
### 6. Financial and Operational Terms
- **Cost share**: Is this the same across HR, Finance, and Research?
- **FTE calculations**: Are these consistent across HR, Finance, and Academic Affairs?
## Governance Structure Questions
### 7. Decision-Making Authority
- **Who has final authority on term definitions?**
    - Subject matter experts?
    - Data governance committee?
    - Legal/compliance for regulatory terms?
- **How do we resolve conflicts between departments?**
    - Example: HR vs. Student Affairs definition of "Student Worker"

### 8. Maintenance and Stewardship
- **Who is responsible for keeping definitions current?**
- **How often should the glossary be reviewed?**
- **What's the approval process for new terms or definition changes?**
### 9. Standards and Conventions
- **What naming conventions should we adopt institution-wide?**
    - Current inconsistencies: "cost share" vs "Cost Share"
    - Title case vs. sentence case vs. system-specific formatting?
- **How do we handle acronyms and abbreviations?**
    - Examples: FMLA, ADA, SOC, IPEDS, COBRA
    - Should these be spelled out in term names?
## Strategic Questions
### 10. Integration with Existing Systems
- **How does this glossary integrate with:**
    - Data catalog tools?
    - Report documentation?
    - Training materials?
    - Policy documents?
### 11. Future State Vision
- **What's the long-term goal for data governance at UVM?**
- **How does this HR glossary fit into broader data management strategy?**
- **Should we establish glossary standards before expanding to other departments?**
### 12. Resource and Timeline Questions
- **What resources are available for ongoing glossary maintenance?**
- **Should we focus on core terms first or attempt comprehensive coverage?**
- **How do we prioritize terms for definition completion?**
## Immediate Decision Points
### 13. Quick Wins Needed
- **Can we establish basic naming conventions now?** (Title case, etc.)
- **Should we remove system-specific terms to separate technical glossary?**
- **Can we assign temporary owners for cross-functional terms?**
### 14. Pilot Approach
- **Should we complete a subset of terms as a pilot?**
    - Suggested focus: Core employee lifecycle terms
    - Test governance processes before full-scale effort
### 15. Communication Strategy
- **How do we communicate glossary decisions to the institution?**
- **What's the change management approach for standardized definitions?**
