## Week 1: Discussion 1 - Introduce Yourself

>[!info]
>**Discussion Aim**: Build community with your peers and explore our working definition of project management through multiple lenses.

To help everyone understand the lens through which you will absorb the materials and exercises of this course, please introduce yourself and share the following:

  - your Champlain program and program year (freshman/sophomore/junior/senior)
  - your working industry (if applicable)
  - your personal working definition of project management (Do not simply regurgitate the definition from the text; make it your own!)

For your follow-up posts to peers, put yourself in your colleagues’ shoes. Based on what they shared about themselves,

  - What might your working definition of project management be in their ‘voice’?
  - How does it differ from your own?
  - Why is it important to recognize the lens through which others come to this conversation?

Please submit your initial post by **Wednesday** at 11:59 pm and all follow-up posts by **Sunday** at 11:59 pm.
## Week 1: Discussion 2 - A Project or Not a Project?
>[!info]
>**Discussion Aim**: Provides an opportunity to apply your learning regarding the distinction between project and non-project work and express that understanding by defending your assessment.

This discussion requires you to reflect on your answers from the [Week 1: Pre Discussion Quiz](https://champlain.instructure.com/courses/2421404/quizzes/8460809 "Week 1 Pre-Discussion Quiz"). Note that this discussion runs **Wednesday - Friday**, as opposed to Wednesday - Sunday.

For your initial post (by **Wednesday** at 11:59 pm), please:

  - Review the results of the pre-activity exercise. 
  - Select **one** of the scenarios from the initial prompt that you categorized as a project and **one** scenario that you categorized as operational work, defending your assessments.
  - Identify specific elements of the scenarios that support your assessments.
  - Use citations (either paraphrase or use direct quotations and, in either case, cite appropriately) from the assigned class materials to support your positions.
  - Reflect on how your personal definition of project management influenced your categorization.

For your follow-up posts to peers (by **Friday** at 11:59 pm), please:

  - Review your colleagues’ positions.
  - Identify a scenario discussed that is **not** the one you used in your initial prompt and which takes a position that differs from your own assessment (from the initial exercise) - this may be because the other student categorized the scenario as project/non-project and you categorized it in the opposite way _or_ you may simply have different supporting evidence.
  - Present and defend an alternative assessment (by categorization or set of evidence).

If, in the unlikely event, you agreed with _every_ student’s categorization _and_ used the same supporting evidence to draw your conclusions, play devil’s advocate and attempt to take and defend the alternative position.

Please submit your initial post by **Wednesday** at 11:59 pm and all follow-up posts through **Friday** at 11:59 pm. The Discussion Grading Rubric is used for this assignment.

## Week 3: Discussion - Risk Assessment for Global Green Books Publishing

>[!info]
>**Discussion Aim**: Provides the opportunity to exercise your learning regarding risk identification, assessment and mitigation planning. You will collaborate to assess and expand upon the risks identified and reflect on your work through the discussion.

Read [Part 2](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/academic-research/academic-pm-case-studies/mini-case-2-risks-at-global-green-books.pdf?v=87a923a1-5cf1-4bfe-a849-00af801a8f61&rev=1d4375a43f334bd9bba059b376ca65a5) of the Global Green Books Publishing Case and complete an initial risk assessment. You may also draw upon information from [Part 1](https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/academic-research/academic-pm-case-studies/mini-case-1-global-green-books.pdf?v=96a7e5de-6a95-4e20-a16a-03915db110fd&rev=87d2889f7b464b6483b1e3dd5734f600) of the Case as necessary.

For your initial post:

- Drawing upon what you know about the case thus far, present at least two (2) risk statements using the following syntax: If _event_ then _outcome_.
- For each risk statement, rate the likelihood of the event occurring and severity of the outcome and impact. Use (High/Medium/Low) as your rating scale for both attributes.
- Identify the impacted area as a project goal or organizational goal. Support your assessment with evidence from the case.

For your follow-up posts to peers, please follow the guidance below:

- **Follow-up post #1**: Review your classmates’ risk statements. Select at least two (2) risk statements and identify the area of complexity relevant to the risk statement. Remember: the areas of complexity are temporal, structural, directional, and technical.

- **Follow-up post #2**: Select at least two (2) risk statements to which you have not yet responded and propose a mitigation strategy for their risk statement. Take into account the project or business goal that must be protected and the area of complexity influencing the risk.

Please see the example below.

*Example:*

**Initial post:**

| Risk Statement                                                                                                               | Likelihood of Occurrence | Severity of Impact |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| If _I forget to complete my initial post_ then _I will not receive credit_ which will affect my overall grade for the class. | Low                      | Medium             |

My class is the project and completing my overall degree is a business objective so the impacted area as written is a project objective.

**Follow-up post #1:**

The area of complexity in play for this risk statement is temporal because there is urgency to complete the task but I do not have a specific plan to complete it, hence why I might forget.

**Follow-up post #2:**

Potential mitigation plan: In order to reduce the likelihood that I forget to complete my initial post and address temporal complexity affecting my project (this class), I will use a daily calendar to remind me of the due date and to-do list that will assign elements of the task to me over several days ahead of the due date.

Please submit your initial post by **Wednesday** at 11:59 pm and all follow-up posts by **Sunday** at 11:59 pm. The Discussion Grading Rubric is used for this assignment.

*Sign up for a 14-day free trial of [Gantt Pro](https://ganttpro.com/)*

**[Links to an external site.](https://ganttpro.com/) to complete this discussion and your Week 5 assignment.**

The initial portion of this discussion is a group exercise. You will work together to brainstorm and estimate activities to include in a project schedule based on the [sample WBS](https://champlain.instructure.com/courses/2421404/files/338237655?wrap=1)
[Download sample WBS](https://champlain.instructure.com/courses/2421404/files/338237655/download?download_frd=1) provided and subsequently develop a schedule and critical path. You are assigned to the following project lifecycle phases according to the first letter of your last name (see the table below). Follow-up posts provide an opportunity to develop a schedule based on the collective input, reflect on how classmates’ personal judgment influenced their schedule and resulting critical path, and reflect on personal learning regarding the challenges of schedule development.

For your initial post (due by **Tuesday** at 11:59 pm):

- Identify 2-3 tasks appropriate to the project phase to which you have been assigned and estimate the duration for those tasks. Do not repeat tasks already identified by other classmates! 

|   |   |
|---|---|

|A-F|Initiation Phase|
|G-K|Planning Phase|
|L-P|Execution Phase|
|Q-Z|Closing Phase|

For your follow-up posts to peers, please follow the guidance and due dates below:

- **Follow-up post #1** (due by **Thursday** at 11:59 pm): Using the tasks identified by your classmates and [GanttPRO](https://ganttpro.com/), generate a schedule for the project. Note that you will need to use your own judgment to determine dependencies. You may add to the tasks identified by classmates as you feel necessary. For simplicity, assume that resources are readily available and no adjustment to the schedule is needed to account for resource availability. Post an image of your schedule and identify and justify which tasks are on the critical path.

- **Follow-up post #2** (due by **Saturday** at 11:59 pm): Review and critique the critical paths formulated by at least two of your peers, using learning from the assigned reading and/or external research. Consider the following:
    - How does their schedule and critical path differ from yours? Why might this be?
    - Which tasks on your classmate’s critical path are most important to protect? Why?

- **Follow-up post #3** (due by **Sunday** at 11:59 pm): Reflect on what you have learned about schedule development as a result of this exercise. How might you approach schedule development differently in the future?

Please submit your initial post by **Tuesday** at 11:59 pm, follow-up post #1 by **Thursday** at 11:59 pm, follow-up post #2 by **Saturday** at 11:59 pm, and follow-up post #3 by **Sunday** at 11:59 pm. The Discussion Grading Rubric is used for this assignment.

## Week 6: Discussion - Earned Value Analysis and Change Management

**Discussion Aim**: Provides an opportunity to practice calculating Earned Value metrics and evaluating change requests through this lens, as well as an opportunity to practice planning a change response, supported by Earned Value metrics.

For your initial post (due by **Wednesday** at 11:59 pm):

- Paraphrase the purpose of Earned Value Management & Earned Value Analysis in your own words (no direct quotes).
- Calculate the following Earned Value Analysis metrics for the scenario provided below. What do we know about the project based on these values?
    - Planned Value (PV)
    - Earned Value (EV)
    - Cost Variance (CV)
    - Cost Performance Index (CPI)
    - Schedule Variance (SV)
    - Schedule Performance Index (SPI)
    - Estimate at Complete (EAC)

**Scenario**: You are the Project Manager on a project. The project has a baselined duration of 10 months and a total budgeted cost of $10,000. Resources have been smoothed so that work is planned to be consistent throughout the project life (no peaks or valleys). At the 6-month mark, the project is reported to be 55% complete. Actual cost is $6,750.

For your follow-up posts to peers, please follow the guidance and due dates below:

- **Follow-up post #1** (due by **Friday** at 11:59 pm): Evaluate and respond to the change request to which you have been assigned

| **Student Last Name** | **Change Request** |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| A-G                   | Change Request 1   |
| H-N                   | Change Request 2   |
| O-Z                   | Change Request 3   |

***Change Request 1***
>A key resource who was scheduled to perform 100% of the project work this month has fallen ill and will not return to work for 30 days. The team has requested an additional resource to work in the ill team member’s absence. This resource will be paid overtime at 150% of the ill team member’s rate.
>
>Should the project manager accept this change request? Calculate EVA metrics to gauge the impact of approving the request vs maintaining status quo as part of your justification. Identify any assumptions you made as part of your EVA calculations.

***Change Request 2***
>The project manager has been informed that the sponsor would like to bring the schedule forward to complete the project one month early. The sponsor has up to $2,000 in management reserve available to support meeting this goal.
>
>Should the project manager accept this change request? Calculate EVA metrics to gauge the impact of approving the request vs maintaining status quo as part of your justification.

***Change Request 3***
>An engineer assigned to the project has identified an alternate material that is 50% less expensive than the one initially proposed for the project. This resource is a core component of the primary deliverable and is more difficult to work with. The engineer estimates that the material will require 10% more effort than planned.

Should the project manager accept the request to change materials? Calculate EVA metrics to gauge the impact of approving the request vs maintaining status quo as part of your justification.

- **Follow-up post #2** (due by **Sunday** at 11:59 pm): Review your classmates’ posts and select at least one whose post addressed the same change request as you. Validate their calculations. Assess their proposed change response. Do EVA metrics support their position? Why or why not?

- **Follow-up post #3** (due by **Sunday** at 11:59 pm): Review your classmates’ posts and select at least one whose post did not address the same change request as you. Validate their calculations. Assess their proposed change response. Do EVA metrics support their position? Why or why not?

Please submit your initial post by **Wednesday** at 11:59 pm, follow-up post #1 by **Friday** at 11:59 pm, and follow-up posts #2 and #3 by **Sunday** at 11:59 pm. The Discussion Grading Rubric is used for this assignment.

## Week 7: Discussion - Is the Cost of Good Quality Worth It?

>[!info]
>**Discussion Aim**: Provides an opportunity to explore your personal and industry expectations of quality in projects and explore how the cost of quality pertains to those expectations.

|A-M|the cost of good quality (COPG) - i.e. the cost of prevention and cost of appraisal - is worth it|
|N-Z|the cost of good quality (COPG) - i.e. the cost of prevention and cost of appraisal - is **not** worth it|

For your follow-up posts to peers, please follow the guidance and due dates below:

- **Follow-up prompt #1** (due by **Friday** at 11:59 pm): Review your classmates’ posts and select at least one that was assigned to the same position as you were. Take the devil’s advocate’s position and (respectfully!) argue it using evidence from your colleague’s initial post and any additional research you deem appropriate.

- **Follow-up prompt #2** (due by **Friday** at 11:59 pm): Review your classmates’ posts and select at least one that was assigned to take the opposite position than you were. Provide evidence from your own experience and research to support and reinforce their position. Do not simply agree with the evidence provided by your classmate.

- **Follow-up prompt #3** (due by **Sunday** at 11:59 pm): Review your classmates’ responses to your original post and share your reflection.
    - Did you agree with the position you were originally assigned to take? Why or why not?
