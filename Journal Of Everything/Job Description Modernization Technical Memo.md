**Technical Advisory Memo: AI-Assisted Job Description Modernization - DRAFT      2025-01-07**

**Context**

UVM maintains approximately 2,500 staff job descriptions. These descriptions currently follow a traditional percentage-based time allocation format. There is an opportunity to modernize these descriptions to align with current industry practices that focus on outcomes and impact rather than rigid time allocations.  
  
**Scope of Work**

The job description portfolio consists of:

- 2,505 total active descriptions (~1.1 million words)
- 646 non-union position descriptions (~353,000 words)
- Average length: 450-550 words per description

**Resource Implications**

Manual revision of these documents would require approximately:

- 325 hours for non-union positions (at an estimated 30 minutes per description)
- 1,200 hours for all positions

In contrast, an AI-assisted approach would require:

- Minimal technical setup (40 hours)
- Estimated upper-bound processing costs of $30-200 for non-union positions
- Human review focused only on flagged descriptions

**Recommendation**

Based on initial testing, I recommend:

1. Starting with a small pilot of 20-30 descriptions to validate the approach
2. Using the pilot to refine the process and establish quality benchmarks
3. If successful, expanding to the full non-union portfolio
4. Using insights gained to evaluate potential broader application

This approach allows for low-risk evaluation of the technology while providing valuable insights for future AI applications in HR processes.
