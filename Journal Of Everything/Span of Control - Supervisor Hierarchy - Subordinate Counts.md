### How These Metrics Help Decision-Making

When presenting these metrics to non-technical stakeholders, you might explain:

"These measurements help us understand our organizational structure beyond just who reports to whom. They show us:

1. Where we might be too dependent on single individuals (high bottleneck scores)
2. Which managers might be stretched too thin or could handle more responsibility (span of control)
3. Who our informal organizational connectors are (high influence scores)

Using these insights, we can make more informed decisions about restructuring, succession planning, and communication improvements."

This framing focuses on the practical business implications rather than the mathematical calculations, making the concepts more accessible to non-technical audiences.
