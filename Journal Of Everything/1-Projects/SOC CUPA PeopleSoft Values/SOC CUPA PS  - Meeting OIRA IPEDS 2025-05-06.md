Hi,

Here is some more detailed information for the Standard Occupational Codes (SOC), CUPA and IPEDS codes:

- SOC Codes are now assigned per position rather than per job code
- The SOC Lookup Table (US_SOC_TBL) in Peoplesoft (PS) now includes the codes officially published by the  Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). See [soc_structure_2018.xlsx](https://uvmoffice-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ijohnson_uvm_edu/EVxytOBIvtZKr2iZZ8yyKs8B4xARoAHsXz0H2J3-jKkt_w?e=gGhQK2) and [soc_2018_definitions.xlsx](https://uvmoffice-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ijohnson_uvm_edu/EX1kOXF6Uh9Ao_hfvpD4MxYB_uQtaJTraL2bxjzaL1LZDg?e=BiPVPQ)
- Assigned official SOC values are stored in the POSITION_DATA table, US_SOC_CD field
- The JOBCODE_TBL continues to hold the historical UVM SOC codes used for proior reporting and non-staff 
- Official POSITION_DATA SOC Codes are currently assigned to Staff  (Administration, Exempt, and Non-Exempt) 
- Grad Assistants, faculty, temps, student worker positions do not have an assigned SOC on POSITION_DATA.
- Approximately 10% of staff (n = 252) are not yet assigned SOC codes. I'll be discussing this alongside long-term maintenance plans with the comp-class team in the near future.
