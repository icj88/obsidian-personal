# Week 4: Overview & Resources

## Work Breakdown Structure and Estimating

This week we will work through processes to establish a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). The WBS is a foundational artifact that ensures the entirety of the project scope is addressed and no incremental scope is included without authorization. Furthermore, the WBS is a direct input to schedule development, which we will cover next week.

In addition to the WBS, we will also explore recognized estimation techniques. These estimation techniques are applied in multiple Knowledge Areas, including Cost Management, Schedule Management and Resource Management, and, as with the WBS, will be foundational for topics in coming weeks.

### Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Explain the purpose of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- Examine the process to develop the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- Generate the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- Define and Debate estimating techniques
- Explore and reflect on key Project Management terms and Knowledge Areas
