Difficult to understand the capabilities for HCM vs Finance

# Introduction
- In-Memory Realtime model -- How is historical data handled? No relational database model?
- Built off of 'business processes' that drive data modification and addition -- Ease of use in-house? Level of support from workday?
- Native Actionable Analytics -- No need for DW and data transfer... what do the reporting customization tools work?
- Designed mobile first -- Yuck
	- Effective communication to EE
	- Looks good... HR use cases for open enrollment, direct deposit encouragement
	- 
- AI model training more effective with in-memory data versus relational -- Is this true? Explore how this works more.
	- Involved with AI regulatory bodies... how much are they designing AI tools versus Us?
	- What is the cost of the AI training and processing?
		- AI "Illuminate" - what exactly is this? Predictive analytics, ML, clustering, LLM?
	- Appreciate emphasis on 'done right', recognizes the AI skepticism
	- Is UVM data on Workday shared for AI modeling?
# HCM Demonstrations
- Dynamic learning system, video with questions and static prompts -- Application to onboarding and benefit explanations...
- Modern design layouts look good.
- Graphical user interface for business process modification and creation
- 
## NoSQL (?) vs RDBMS
- Underlying db tech in use -> Ease of use for adhoc querying and regular reporting. 
- Version management, data transfer and business logic implementation? -- Difficult for ETS to transition to new languages?
- Majority data driven by 'Effective Dates' -- Enables easy future dated reports, used for versioning of business processes
- Emphasis on 'Live' data. -- How exactly does this differ from our current system
- Technical demo can be done at later date
Security -- Does it include both row and field level security permissions?
# Recruiting & Onboarding
Staffing Model allows for both Position Management and Job Management
Lots of uncertainty about initialization and setup
Skill match AI compares selected skills to job skills -- How to game?

# Benefits & Compensation
- Market Comp data requires integration with extrenal vendor -- Does this allow for multiple compensation sources simultaneously?
