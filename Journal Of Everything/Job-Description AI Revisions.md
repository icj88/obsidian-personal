## Goal
Revise/update staff job descriptions into a standardized modern format.

## Background
Current job-descriptions (as opposed to broader position descriptions) utilize a percentage-time based format. 

Modern job-descriptions, as described in [A New Approach to Writing Job Descriptions](https://archive.ph/wo6NL#selection-1117.5-1117.51)(Nieto-Rodriguez, 2023), focus on flexibility rather than rigid time or percent approaches.
