Great middle age romcom with office vibes and boss/secretary.         
love it so far (ep 5/12)
dunno what more I could want.

up to episode 6 and it's still fun. Lots of sexual tension between the leads. Let's see where it goes from here. Still waiting on the second leads and more explanation of the possible fire backstory. Could also introduce the ex-wife? ughh, that would suck.
