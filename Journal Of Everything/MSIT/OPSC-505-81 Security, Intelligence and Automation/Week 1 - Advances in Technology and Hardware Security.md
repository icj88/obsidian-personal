# Advances in Technology and Hardware Security
Hardware security is a broad concept. For some, it refers to the physical security of an organization’s network and computing devices, while for others, it involves the use of specialized appliances—such as firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems—to protect against network vulnerabilities. With recent technological advances, our understanding of hardware security and the range of available options, particularly from chip manufacturers, has evolved.

This week, we will explore the challenges posed by these advances in hardware technology for information security professionals and the organizations that adopt them. We’ll also evaluate the decision-making process regarding when an organization should embrace or avoid adopting new technologies.

## Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Identify advances in hardware technology that are increasing the security of computing devices.
- Summarize hardware attacks based on a classification scheme.
- Explain the security challenges of building secure systems.
- Assess whether deployment of specific hardware technologies will improve the security of an organization’s people, processes, and technology.
