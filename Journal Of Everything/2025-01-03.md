Worked from home today. Very quiet at work. I stayed up until 4am watching the CDrama [[Blossom]], so I slept in super late. Thankfully, I have [[temp.ps1]] powershell script that keeps my computer awake and Teams status as 'available.'

 I've updated my [[uvmR package]]'s import_pa_users() function to  access my local OneDrive datasets rather than SharePoint,  there's still a lot of updates/refinement for this package. I've been focused on python development, but it's still not quite clicking. It seems more difficult to implement fast, off-the-cuff projects in the python space. I'm sure that it is faster, and larger projects would benefit from the true programming language. Oh well. It'll be good to use both. 

Spent some time refining my [[Job-Description AI Revisions]] project. 

Sleep schedule still fucked up. Slept 5-8pm, 9-1am. Not a good start on my [[2025 Goals]] for sleep : (

In better news, I'm in the thralls of nicotine withdrawal. Will be amazing to kick this habit. No more zyne. No more vape. Technically, my vape is somewhere, I just kind of lost it.
