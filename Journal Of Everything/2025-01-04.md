# üìù Notes
- Wokeup early... oddly couldn't sleep, even after disjointed sleep times. hmmm.
- Continuing [[Blossom]] watch. Made it to ep 26/34. Getting bored? Might Drop.
- Started new CDrama, [[Fake It Till You Make It]]. So far, so good. Only watched 2 eps. Liking the work-based themes.
- Soccer Day, Arsenal to play Brighton Hove Albion, evening gametime. 
	- Arsenal Ties 1-1 after a boring boring game. This year has been horrible. Definitely not winning the league.
- Beginning development of [[Ski Trip France, Kyrgyzstan, 2025]]
- Watching some hasanabi. Coverage of terrorist attacks in new orleans and trump tower Las Vegas. 
- Serious Water Leak from the water softener! Maybe I should create a [[House Maintenance]] list?
