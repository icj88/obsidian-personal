## Common Efficiency Ratios in Higher Education
### 1. Student-to-Staff FTE Ratio
- Administrative departments (e.g., HR, Finance):
    - _Typical:_ 1 staff FTE per 100–300 students
    - _Highly efficient:_ 1 FTE per 300+ students
- Student services (e.g., advising, career services):
    - _Typical:_ 1 FTE per 100–200 students
    - Lower ratios may be expected if personalized services are emphasized.
### 2. Staff FTE per 100 Students
- An alternative framing, often used in dashboards:
    - _HR example:_ 0.3–0.5 HR FTEs per 100 employees is often cited as a benchmark.
    - For student-facing services: ~0.5–1 FTE per 100 students can be typical
### 3. HR-Specific Efficiency Ratios
- HR FTE per total institutional headcount:
    - _Benchmark:_ 1 HR FTE per 75–125 employees
    - In more automated or centralized systems: 1 HR FTE per 150+ employees
#### 4. Finance/Business Office
- _Benchmark:_ 1 finance FTE per 75–125 employees, or per $10M–$25M in budget responsibility

### Considerations:
- **Automation and systems**: The more automated and integrated the systems, the higher the student or employee load an FTE can support.
- **Service expectations**: Institutions with a high-touch service model (e.g., more student or faculty engagement) may need lower ratios.
- **Decentralization**: More decentralized models often require more FTEs across units.
