# MVP Data Engineering Pipeline Plan

Let me outline an agile plan for building a minimal viable product (MVP) for your data engineering pipeline, followed by features for later iterations.

## MVP Components

### Sprint 1: Foundation Setup (2 weeks)

- Set up Docker environment with basic configuration
- Install DuckDB with minimal schema design
- Create simple Docker Compose file to run services locally

### Sprint 2: Basic Data Flow (2 weeks)

- Configure Airbyte with 1-2 critical data sources
- Implement basic data extraction schedules
- Set up initial landing tables in DuckDB

### Sprint 3: Simple Transformations (2 weeks)

- Install dbt core with basic project structure
- Develop 3-5 essential transformation models
- Create simple testing framework for data quality

### Sprint 4: Basic Orchestration (2 weeks)

- Deploy lightweight Airflow instance
- Create DAGs for the established extraction and transformation processes
- Implement simple error handling and notifications

### Sprint 5: Essential Monitoring (2 weeks)

- Set up Grafana with basic dashboards
- Configure essential alerts for pipeline failures
- Deploy logging for critical components

## Features for Future Iterations

### Data Quality Enhancement

- Advanced data validation rules
- Data lineage tracking
- Anomaly detection systems

### Scale and Performance

- Optimization of DuckDB for larger datasets
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Query performance tuning

### Advanced Orchestration

- Complex dependency management
- Dynamic DAG generation
- Backfill automation

### Extended Connectivity

- Additional data source connectors
- API integration framework
- Real-time data processing capabilities

### Comprehensive Monitoring

- End-to-end pipeline visibility
- Advanced metrics for data quality
- Cost monitoring and optimization

### Governance and Security

- Role-based access controls
- Audit logging
- Data masking for sensitive information
