>To help everyone understand the lens through which you will absorb the materials and exercises of this course, please introduce yourself and share the following:
> - your Champlain program and program year (freshman/sophomore/junior/senior)
> - your working industry (if applicable)
> - your personal working definition of project management (Do not simply regurgitate the definition from the text; make it your own!)

For your follow-up posts to peers, put yourself in your colleagues’ shoes. Based on what they shared about themselves,

- What might your working definition of project management be in their ‘voice’?
- How does it differ from your own?
- Why is it important to recognize the lens through which others come to this conversation?
