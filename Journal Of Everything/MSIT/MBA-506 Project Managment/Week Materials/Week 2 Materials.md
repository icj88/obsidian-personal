# Week 2: Overview & Resources
## Project Initiation

This week we will discuss the initiation phase of a project where we rationalize the project scope and alignment to organizational strategy and get the formal approval to begin the project via a charter. We will also explore the concept of complexity and its relevance during initial project definition.
### Objectives
By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Define complexity attributes in project definition
- Assess complexity attributes in a project
- Define project scope
- Assess project scope
- Produce a Project Charter
- Explore and reflect on key Project Management terms and Knowledge Areas

# Week 2: Lesson - Project Initiation
## The project Lifecycle

While there are multiple project lifecycles, any that are considered predictive lifecycles (also known as Waterfall project type) follow four sequential phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution, and closing - with a fifth phase, Monitoring & Controlling - winding through all but the first phase.

## Project Initiation
### Initiation Definition and Initiating Process Group 

Initiation occurs before all other phases or stages or the project. During this phase, we *assess the project to understand the requirements, risks, stakeholders, and deliverables.* 

Unlike the initiation phase, the initiating process group is a set of processes that span multiple Knowledge Areas. The process we will learn about this week, *Developing the Project Charter*, lies within the Initiating Process Group and Project Integration Managment Knowledge Area. This process culminates in production of the final artifact of the Initiation phase of the project lifecycle - the project charter.

### Project Scope Definition

See pages 155-178 in Darnall & Preston's [_Project management from simple to complex_](https://www.opentextbooks.org.hk/system/files/export/38/38453/pdf/Project_Management_from_Simple_to_Complex_38453.pdf)

In order to properly define scope, we must address the following elements, which are present in the project charter. Taken together, these elements give the project raise d'etre - or reason to be - its overall objectives and their link back to organization strategy, constraints that must be addressed or accommodate, the work that will and won't be performed, and the measures that will reflect project success.

**Project Justification**: Why are we doing this? What organizational strategy does it support?

**Project Purpose/Goal**: What is the business value outcome (aligned to strategy)?

**Project Deliverables**: What are the tangible artifacts, products and/or services delivered by the project (which enable the organization to realize the business value).

**Complexity Attributes**: Which characteristic(s) of the project or its environment are difficult to manage due to human behavior, system behavior, and/or ambiguity and must be addressed in project planning and execution in order to successfully deliver the project?

**Constraints**: What limits areas of the project? (e.g. resources, funding, legal requirements, other initiatives)

**Scope**:
- In Scope - What must be done/impacted/delivered?
- Out of Scope - What are they definitely not doing/delivering as part of this project?

**Success Criteria**: How will we know that the goal was successfully achieved?

### Project Justification, Purpose & Deliverables

Most research will attribute project failure to poorly-defined outcomes or objectives. Additionally, projects that are poorly aligned or not aligned at all with organizational strategy expend organizational resources while delivering little true value. 

In order to effectively capture the project objectives, we start with understanding the business requirements or objectives. These lay out the overarching goals which the project's outcomes will address. 

The alignment between project outcomes and larger organizational goals extends to project documentation. For example, terminology should reflect the business value being pursued and delivered, not simply the outcome or deliverable of the project. Asking *Buy Why?* can help the project manager assess the project justification and purpose. The answer to this question must relate to the larger organization undertaking the project.

### Project Complexity & Constraints

See Pages 40-52 in Darnall & Preston's [_Project management from simple to complex_](https://www.opentextbooks.org.hk/system/files/export/38/38453/pdf/Project_Management_from_Simple_to_Complex_38453.pdf)

>Complexity is a characteristic of a program or project or its environment that is difficult to manage due to human behavior, system behavior, and/or ambiguity.
>	- PMI, 2014

The PMI recognizes four types of complexity:
- **Structural** - a high degree of interdependence across all areas of the organization in scope
- **Temporal** - urgency to achieve compliance, but without a specific plan to enact it
- **Technical** - uncertainty in how the organization and/or processes will be modified to ensure compliance.
- **Directional** - broad direction without specifics of how to proceed

The Darnell-Preston Complexity Index (DCPI) organizaes project attributes into four borad categories indicative of project complexity:

![[Pasted image 20250115221854.png]]

The project manager must analyze the attributes of the project in order to develop an execution plan that accounts for complexity by addressing all elements of scope, schedule, budget, and organizational/stakeholder impact. Failure to incorporate specific tactics to address complexities increases the risk of project failure. 

For example, a project may deliver a new high-demand product. If the project does not address the technical/technological complexity of the new manufacturing process, the cost of manufacturing inefficiencies or lack of ability to reach quality targets may greater reduce if not remove all project profitability.

Many attributes used to describe complexity represent constraints on the project. During project scoping, the project manager must recognize where constraints can be managed or negotiated and where they are rigid and immovable. For example, legal requirements are one of the environmental attributes recognized in the DCPI. (... side note, it is not clear how this example exemplifies management of constraints).
### In-Scope, Out-of-Scope

Scope is defined as the "*sum of the products, services, and results to be provided as a project,*" and the "*work performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions.* "

This defines scope as work in both the noun (what was produced) and verb (the processes used to produce) form. 

Scope documentation identifies both the outcomes and the efforts to create them. This includes internal processes such as approval workflows and project governance. Conversely, the documentation will specific things explicitly won't be pursed and are deemed 'out-of-scope'
### Success Criteria

Success criteria are the standards, means, and metrics by which the project will be judged as a success or failure. These criteria should be framed as [[SMART Goals]] - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timebound.

The criteria should be tied to the various elements contained in the project scope and extend beyond simplistic and basic expectations such as 'in-budget' or 'on-time'.

#### Interactive Reebok Case-Study
Read the Scope Definition. Determine SMART attributes for each defined success criteria.
##### Scope Definition
- **Project Justification**:
    - Adidas Group’s ‘Route 2015’, strategy aims at growing the business of the entire Adidas Group compared to the expected 2010 results by 45% to 50%. As part of that strategy, Reebok’s brand strategy is to “change the way people perceive, define and experience fitness”.
- **Project Purpose/Goal**:
    - This project will develop and execute a marketing plan that expands consumer definition of fitness and consumer perception of Reebok as the fitness shoe of choice. By improving consumer perception of the brand, the project will increase Reebok sales and contribute to overall business growth of the Adidas Group.
- **Project Deliverables**:
    - Market research on fitness segments beyond traditional sports (basketball, etc) and current fitness trends (e.g. running) to identify emerging segments.
    - Consumer research on consumer perception of the brand.
    - Partnership agreements with identifiable celebrities known for their commitment to health and fitness. Commercial print and television presence with endorsement from partnered celebrities, focused on target segments.
- **Complexity Attributes**:
    - The overarching Route 15 strategy has directional complexity in that it is a broad target without specifics of how the target will be met. This project definition gives focused, actionable direction tied to the overarching strategy. As there are multiple avenues that could be employed in pursuit of Route 15’s objectives, Governance will be established to prevent scope creep beyond the project deliverables and approaches defined here.
    - As Adidas Group and Reebok are large, global organizations with multiple divisions, there is structural complexity that may impede the coordinated and efficient execution of the project. To mitigate this complexity, the project will employ a robust communications plan both internal to the project team and outward facing to stakeholders across the organization. In doing so, the project will surface resource constraints and potential conflicting direction.
- **Constraints**:
    - Section 5 of the FTC Act
    - Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, effective April 21, 2000
    - Data Protection Regulations (varies by global market)
- **Scope**:
    - **In Scope**:
        - Market Research
        - Consumer Research
        - Baselined Consumer Perception and Consumer Sentiment metrics
        - Selection of featured product(s)
        - Partnership Agreement(s)
        - Graphic Design for Print and Media
        - Recorded Testimonials/Endorsements
        - Written Testimonials/Endorsements
        - Post-execution measure Consumer Perception and Consumer Sentiment metrics quarterly
    - **Out of Scope**:
        - Developing/executing new contracts with photographers - project will use the existing engagement
        - Adding products to the Reebok portfolio
        - Markets other than fitness
- **Success Criteria**:
    1. Net Promoter Score (NPS) improved by 5+ points 24 mths post implementation
    2. Execution of agreement with celebrities
    3. Composite CSAT benchmark improved by 2+% 24 mths post implementation
    4. CEO approval of print ads in Good Housekeeping on or before submission date
    5. No sanctions imposed by the FTC
    6. Online sales increased by 30%
    7. Employee retention

Now select which attributes of SMART are present in each Success criteria. 
##### SMART Criteria Answers
**Answers**
1. Net Promoter Score (NPS) improved by 5+ points 24 mths post implementation
    - Answer: S, M, A, R, T
    - Explanation: Specific because they use metrics with a target value; measurable because the metrics are broadly recognized standards and the data that underlies them should be available to any consumer products organization; achievable based on historical trends in the industry; relevant because they tie directly to the project objectives which are also clearly tied to strategy; and time-bound because they set target dates.
2. Execution of agreement with celebrities
    - Answer: S, M, A (not R, T)
    - Explanation: Specific because it has a required outcome, measurable as true or false, and achievable assuming both parties' legal departments are cooperative. However, it isn’t time bound and, more importantly, it’s not relevant because it is not indicative of whether or not this project has successfully improved customer perception. This success criteria is more appropriate as a milestone event in the project.
3. Composite CSAT benchmark improved by 2+% 24 mths post implementation
    - Answer: S, M, A, R, T
    - Explanation: Specific because they use metrics with a target value; measurable because the metrics are broadly recognized standards and the data that underlies them should be available to any consumer products organization; achievable based on historical trends in the industry; relevant because they tie directly to the project objectives which are also clearly tied to strategy; and time bound because they set target dates.
4. CEO approval of print ads in Good Housekeeping on or before submission date
    - Answer: S, M, A, T (not R)
    - Explanation: Specific because it states who approves and what they approve. It is measurable as true or false. It is achievable given that the project scope includes graphic design, and it’s time bound to a milestone. However, it is not relevant because it is not indicative of whether or not the project has successfully improved customer perception. This criteria is more appropriate as a milestone event.
5. No sanctions imposed by the FTC
    - Answer: S, M, A (not R, T)
    - Explanation: Specific because it states what will be measured, measurable because FTC sanctions would be public knowledge, and achievable because we can assume a global, publicly traded company has access to marketing & legal experts who would steer clear of violating regulations. However, it is not time-bound and also not indicative that the project succeeded in improving customer perception (i.e. relevant).
6. Online sales increased by 30%
    - Answer: S, M (not A, R, T)
    - Explanation: Specific because it sets a target and a metric, and measurable because the company is likely to track online sales. However, sales growth of that magnitude is not realistic (achievable) as a result of this project, is not exclusively indicative of the project’s success in improving consumer sentiment (other projects and environmental/economic factors could influence sales growth), and the criteria is not time bound.
7. Employee retention
    - Answer: M (not S, A, R, T)
    - Measurable because the HR department likely captures this metric, but the criteria does not have a target (not specific) or a timeline and as a result cannot be achievable. Furthermore, employee retention is not correlated to how well the project improves consumer perception.
