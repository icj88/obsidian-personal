		# Week 1: Overview & Resources

## Introduction and Foundational Principles
This week we’ll work on establishing a foundation for the modules to come. Our focus will be to align on some core definitions for the ‘hard skills’ of project management and establish a shared vocabulary that is present throughout the real-world project management community of practice. We’ll also learn what a project is, and what it isn’t. Finally, we’ll look at the ‘soft skills’ that contribute to a project manager’s effectiveness.

Some things to note as you work through the module:

1. The resources are intentionally listed in a recommended order of consumption to align with the topics in the discussions and assignment.
2. Note that we have three discussions this week. Due dates differ so that we avoid exhausting a topic and limit repeating each other. Please take note of the due dates!
### Objectives
By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Define project management
- Describe the distinction between projects and non-project work (i.e. operations)
- Categorize work as project or non-project work
- Identify and Explain key Project Management terms and Knowledge Areas
- Identify, Relate and Assess PM skills and their influence on project success

# Week 1: Lesson - PM Terms & Knowledge Areas

>According to the 2018 Pulse of the Profession survey conducted by the Project Management Institute (PMI), “9.9% of every dollar is wasted due to poor project performance—that’s $99 million for every $1 billion invested”.

The standardized practices of project management such as scheduling, cost control, risk management, planning and quality management - the ‘hard skills’ - are one of the best ways to reduce risk and improve project outcomes. As a future manager of an organization, it is critical that you, and other managers, understand the principles of project management and the techniques used to successfully complete projects.

The results of the 2023 _Pulse of the Profession_ survey emphasize the importance of ‘soft skills’ such as adaptability, empathy, innovativeness and strategic thinking as well as traditional ‘soft skills’ like communications and relationship building in addition to the ‘hard skills’ previously mentioned. 

>The PMI states, “Built on top of a solid foundation of technical skills, [soft skills] enable project managers to align their projects to organizational objectives and inspire their teams to work together, solve problems and deliver results that contribute value to the organization and its customers.”

This course will provide you with an industry-recognized framework to manage projects toward more successful results and provide the opportunity to exercise both hard and soft Project Management skills.

## But What is a Project?
It can be difficult to differentiate between projects and operations because they share a number of characteristics. Both are performed by people, constrained by limited resources and planned, executed and controlled. Operations expect to produce a consistent result and the same operation is repeated on a scheduled basis within the constraints of available resources (people, materials and budget). Projects also expect to deliver an outcome that is consistent with expectations and the ability to achieve that outcome is constrained by time, cost and resources.

Now take a moment to explore the differences between projects and operations. Click on the information icon to see some examples of each.

### Week 1: Lecture - Interactive Transcript 1
A project is “a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service" (PMI, 2017). Some important words to take from this definition are _temporary_ and _unique_.  A project always has a clear start and end; it is finite and does not go on indefinitely, though it may hand off a process (i.e. service) to ongoing operations when the project team disbands.  Additionally, a project creates something unique or new to the organization - though not necessarily to the world.  An example would be developing and introducing a new gaming console.  Gaming consoles exist today, but so long as the console is a new product for the organization and/or contains an element that has never been included (by the organization or the world) before, the effort can be defined as a project.  In contrast, mass production of the console after the market release is ongoing operations because it continues indefinitely and is no longer resulting in something unique.

Industries that produce physical things are the easiest to relate to in terms of identifying projects, but projects don’t just create things.  FEMA responses to natural disasters, for example, are projects.  The disasters are unique and the response to them is a temporary, albeit very important, effort.

Introduction of new regulations can also be projectized.  For example, when the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was made law, organizations needed to promptly define and implement internal controls across their business, in some cases requiring significant modifications to existing workflows and the addition of new roles and responsibilities.  One of our instructors was working at a major investment bank during this time period and can attest to the significance of the change in terms of its broad reach across business process workflows and the urgency with which compliance needed to be reached.  She shared, “the scale of the SOX project was enormous.  The project marshaled resources from every area of the business to conduct an exhaustive review, design and change effort.”

In contrast to projects, operations activities occur when members of the organization execute pre-established procedures or routines to produce the _same_ result or service over and over again.  The outcomes are not unique (i.e. not first creation or first use) and the effort continues indefinitely (i.e. no clear end).  Some examples of ongoing operations include restaurant work (prep, cook, clean, repeat) and quality control in commercial manufacturing (run test, analyze results, report results, repeat).

Sometimes the product or service produced by a project is completed the first time within the structure of the project and then becomes ongoing operations. The dividing line between first time and every other time can be difficult to distinguish, especially when ongoing operations need to make minor adjustments (for example, adjusting the tolerances to a manufacturing process as trends are identified by the quality control process over time). In that case, we look at the project structure to identify the demarcation point. A well organized project will establish its target end state and execute routines to wrap up the project engagement and disband the team.
## What is Project Management?

Project Management is “the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities in order to meet or exceed stakeholder needs and expectations from a project.” (PMI, 2017).

If that sounds pretty amorphous, don’t worry. Through this course, you will become familiar with the tools and techniques - hard skills - of project management and walk away with a set of knowledge and hard and soft skills that you can apply immediately.

## PM Hard Skills - Knowledge Areas and Process Groups

While many people think only of the Iron Triangle of scope, cost and time when they think of project management, the Project Management Institute (PMI) recognizes ten project management Knowledge Areas. Over the coming weeks, we will explore these Knowledge Areas, with the exception of Project Procurement Management, and the various processes within.

### Knowledge Areas
#### Project Integration Management
Includes the processes and activities to identify, define, combine, unify, and coordinate the various processes and project management activities within the Project Management Process Groups.
#### Project Scope Management
Includes the processes required to ensure that the project includes all the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully.
#### Project Schedule Management
Includes the processes required to manage the timely completion of the project.
#### Project Cost Management
Includes the processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding, managing, and controlling costs so the project can be completed within the approved budget.
#### Project Quality Management
Includes the processes for incorporating the organization's quality policy regarding planning, managing, and controlling project and product quality requirements, in order to meet stakeholders’ expectations.
#### Project Resource Management
Includes the processes to identify, acquire, and manage the resources needed for the successful completion of the project.
#### Project Communications Management
Includes the processes required to ensure timely and appropriate planning, collection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management, control, monitoring, and ultimate disposition of project information.
#### Project Risk Management
Includes the processes of conducting risk management planning, identification, analysis, response planning, response implementation, and monitoring risk on a project.
#### Project Procurement Management
Includes the processes necessary to purchase or acquire products, services, or results needed from outside the project team.
#### Project Stakeholder Management
Includes the processes required to identify the people, groups, or organizations that could impact or be impacted by the project, to analyze stakeholder expectations and their impact on the project, and to develop appropriate management strategies for effectively engaging stakeholders in project decisions and execution.

### Process Groups
Below is a depiction of the Knowledge Areas mapped to the 49 processes in the different Process Groups.

**Watch Out**: While the Process Groups have similar names to the phases of a project lifecycle, they are not indicative of phases. All Process Groups can occur within any phase of the lifecycle and the processes can be repeated as often as necessary in each phase.

## A Standardized Framework & Vocabulary

This course follows the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and uses the 6th edition of the text because of its clear alignment between process and knowledge areas. Later editions move away from the explicit process definition that allows students and practitioners to establish a solid foundational understanding and branch into hybrid (Waterfall / Agile combinations) and other tailored approaches. Students who continue through the certification or degree program should expect to see later versions of the PMBOK in the higher-level courses.

Project Management practices cut across disciplines and organizational boundaries. The best practice processes and techniques apply regardless of the project, industry or organization. In other words, project management is industry agnostic, which not only opens a high degree of mobility in a career path should you choose to pursue the role in practice but makes your learning in this course extensible and valuable regardless of your area of study.

Terms that practitioners and managers alike should recognize are defined below.
- **Budget** - the approved estimate for the project; composed of the cost estimate for each work breakdown component and schedule activity.
- **Issue** - an event or condition that has occurred and has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives.  Issues are realized events.  
- **Project Sponsor** - the project ‘champion’ who provides resources and support for the project.  The person to whom final accountability for success lies.
- **Project Team** - a set of individuals performing the work of the project to deliver the defined scope.
- **Risk** - an unrealized event or condition that may have a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives.  Risks are forecast and have not yet occurred.  Risks can be positive (i.e. opportunities) or negative (i.e. threats).
- **Schedule** - a model that presents linked activities with planned start and end dates, durations, dependencies, milestones and assigned resources.  May be presented as a graphical arrangement (e.g. Gantt chart, Network Diagram) or a nested task list.
- **Scope** - The sum of the products, services, and results to be provided within and by the project.  The work to be performed to deliver the product, services, or result with the specified features and functions.
- **Stakeholder** - any individual or group that may affect, be affected by, or even perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity or outcome of the project.  Includes the Project Sponsor and Project Team.
- **Work Breakdown Structure** - a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work; a critical input to schedule development.
