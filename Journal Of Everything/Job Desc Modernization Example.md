## LLM Reasoning Process

The user wants to transform job descriptions into a structured markdown format. I need to extract information from the provided text and organize it according to the specified schema.

Here's a breakdown of the transformation process:

1. Identify the Position Title: The first sentence mentions "HR Analyst", so that will be the title
2. Extract Role Summary: Combine the initial descriptive sentences to form a concise summary of the role's purpose and impact
3. Identify Key Responsibilities: Each section with a percentage represents a major responsibility area
4. Transform Percentages to Priority: The percentages indicate the relative importance of each area. Higher percentages mean higher priority
5. Consolidate Low Priority Responsibilities: The 'Training' (5%) and 'Perform additional assigned duties' (5%) sections will be combined into 'Additional Responsibilities'
6. Group Related Tasks: Within each responsibility area, list the specific tasks mentioned
7. Extract Success Indicators: Infer measurable outcomes from the task descriptions
8. Format in Markdown: Structure the extracted information using the provided markdown schema
