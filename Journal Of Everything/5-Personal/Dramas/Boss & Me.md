Strangely addictive? Story of a daffy chick who gets a job because she could donate her blood to save the "Boss's" sister. Basically all the characters are nice people which is good. The single negative chick 'left the company' lol.

It's 32 episodes long. I've watched 10/32 episodes. Some drag and end up with little happening, but it's all good so far. 

Negatives includes the ML who can be a jerk to the FL. FL can be a little dumb? They just introduced a CPA element, so hopefully she becomes a bit sharper. Otherwise, her bubbly personality is nice.
