A complexity analysis in the context of job architecture is an assessment of how intricate and varied your organizational structure is across different dimensions. It helps determine how many distinct salary bands you'll need to appropriately represent your organization's roles. Here's what this involves:
## Complexity Analysis Explained

### Quantitative Measures
- **Hierarchical Depth**: Count the number of distinct reporting levels from entry-level to executive
- **Organizational Breadth**: Analyze the number of distinct job families and sub-families
- **Role Variation**: Calculate how many unique job titles exist within each family/level combination
- **Skill Differentiation**: Measure the degree of specialized skills required across similar positions
### Qualitative Assessment
- **Decision-Making Authority**: Evaluate how decision rights vary across levels
- **Impact Scope**: Assess differences in organizational impact from one level to the next
- **Knowledge Requirements**: Analyze education/experience requirements across roles
- **Market Differentiation**: Determine if external markets recognize similar distinctions
### Practical Application
1. Create a matrix mapping your job families, sub-families, career types, and levels
2. Count the number of populated cells in this matrix
3. Identify where meaningful differences exist between adjacent cells
4. Look for natural breakpoints where responsibilities significantly change

The goal is to determine the minimum number of bands needed to represent meaningful differences in job value, without creating unnecessary complexity that would make the system difficult to administer.

When combined with your salary clustering analysis, complexity analysis helps ensure your band structure reflects both organizational reality and compensation patterns, rather than forcing an artificial structure onto your organization.
