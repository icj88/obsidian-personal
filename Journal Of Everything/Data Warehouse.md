This is definitely a project that requires careful planning given its strategic importance and complexity. Let me ask some key questions to better understand the scope and requirements:

1. Current State Assessment:

- What HR systems/data sources will need to be integrated into this warehouse?
	- PeopleSoft oracle database that manages payroll processes and records, job records, employee demographics, and employee history.
	- PeopleAdmin online service for Applicant Tracking and Position Managment
	- 
- What is your current reporting process and what are its pain points?

2. Stakeholder & Requirements:

- Who are the key stakeholders beyond HR and managers that need access to this data?
- Are there any specific compliance or data privacy requirements (like GDPR, CCPA) that need to be considered?
- What are these "current initiatives" you mentioned that the warehouse needs to support?

3. Technical Context:

- Do you have a preferred technology stack or existing data warehouse infrastructure?
- Who will be responsible for maintaining the warehouse once implemented?
- What's your current data governance framework?

4. Timeline & Resources:
 
- Do you have a target completion date?
- What internal resources (both technical and HR) will be available for this project?
- Is there a defined budget for this initiative?

Before diving into a project plan, understanding these aspects will help ensure we create a comprehensive strategy that aligns with your organization's needs and capabilities. Which of these areas would you like to discuss first?
