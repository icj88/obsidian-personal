When presenting these metrics to non-technical stakeholders, you might explain:

"These measurements help us understand our organizational structure beyond just who reports to whom. They show us:

1. Where we might be too dependent on single individuals (high bottleneck scores)
2. Which managers might be stretched too thin or could handle more responsibility (span of control)
3. Who our informal organizational connectors are (high influence scores)

Using these insights, we can make more informed decisions about restructuring, succession planning, and communication improvements."

This framing focuses on the practical business implications rather than the mathematical calculations, making the concepts more accessible to non-technical audiences.

## Span of Control Ratio

**Technical definition:** The ratio of direct reports to total reports (direct + indirect) for a manager.

**Non-technical explanation:** "This number shows how hands-on a manager is versus how much they delegate through layers of other managers. A higher ratio (closer to 1.0) means the manager directly supervises most of their organization. A lower ratio means they work through several layers of other managers.

For example, if Jane directly manages 5 people but has 50 total employees in her organization, her span of control ratio is 0.1 or 10%. This suggests she relies heavily on middle managers. If Bob directly manages 8 people and has a total of 10 employees, his ratio is 0.8 or 80%, showing he's more directly involved in supervision."
