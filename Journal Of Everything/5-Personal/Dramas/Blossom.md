Chinese historical period piece. Romance. Themes centered around fate, women's rights and freedom.

Airing late 2024, 34 episodes @ 45min / episode.

Currently on ep 24. Getting a bit tedious. Resolution or at least drama around FL's family has subsided. I don't feel any connection to ML's family struggles, the focus of the last couple episodes....
